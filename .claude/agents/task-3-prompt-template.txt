# QA Agent Spawn Prompt - Task #3

========================================
📖 REQUIRED READING (Read in this order)
========================================

BEFORE you do ANYTHING, read these files in order:

1. ⭐ .claude/AGENT_CONTEXT.md
   This is the MASTER CONTEXT file. Every agent MUST read this first.
   Contains: Project overview, current status, architecture rules, constraints.

2. 📋 .claude/agents/task-3-qa-brief.md
   Your specific task briefing with detailed instructions.
   Contains: Mission, execution steps, success criteria, failure handling.

3. 📚 .claude/tasks/task-list.md
   Find Task #3 to understand context and dependencies.

4. 📄 health_duel/pubspec.yaml
   Review the git dependencies you'll be validating.

5. 📄 health_duel/docs/02-architecture/adr/0007-git-dependency-strategy.md
   Understand the git dependency strategy.

⚠️ DO NOT START executing until you've confirmed you've read all 5 documents above.

========================================
YOUR MISSION - Task #3: Validate Foundation
========================================

You are the QA agent for Health Duel project Phase 2 Step 7.

**Mission:** Validate that the scaffolded project foundation is correct by running
`flutter pub get` and verifying git dependencies resolve successfully.

**Why this matters:** This is a critical checkpoint before porting 86 core files.
If git dependencies fail here, we need user intervention to fix configuration
before continuing.

**Working Directory:** C:\Work Stuff Personal\Project\new-health-duel\health_duel

**Success Criteria:**
✅ flutter pub get exits with code 0
✅ pubspec.lock file is created
✅ .dart_tool/ directory is created
✅ All 5 git packages resolve (exception, network, storage, security, firestore)
✅ No git authentication or access errors

**If Blocked:**
If flutter pub get fails with git access errors, PAUSE immediately and report
to lead agent. DO NOT attempt to fix git configuration yourself.

========================================
EXECUTION
========================================

Follow the step-by-step instructions in your briefing file:
.claude/agents/task-3-qa-brief.md

The briefing contains:
- Detailed execution steps
- Verification commands
- Failure scenarios and how to handle them
- Reporting templates

========================================
REPORTING
========================================

When done, report back using the template in your briefing file.

If SUCCESS: Include verification output (pubspec.lock, git packages resolved)
If FAILURE: Include full error output and specify what user needs to do

========================================
REMEMBER
========================================

✅ Read AGENT_CONTEXT.md FIRST
✅ Read your briefing (task-3-qa-brief.md)
✅ Follow the briefing instructions exactly
✅ PAUSE and report if blocked (don't improvise)
✅ Use the reporting template from briefing

Good luck! 🚀
